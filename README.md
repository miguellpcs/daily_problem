# daily_coding_problems
 A different problem (and headache) everyday
# Day 1:
      This problem was recently asked by Google.
      Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
      
      Classified as: Easy
      My impression: Very easy

      Challenge:
      LINEAR TIME!

      Diary:
      It was pretty easy to solve in linear time when I remembered that python takes constant time to verify if a given value is a valid key of a dictionary. HASH TABLES, BABY.

# Day 2:
      This problem was asked by Uber.
      Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array  except the one at i.

      Classified as: Hard
      My impression: Easy

      Challenge:
      To not use division >:(

      Diary:
      Very easy using division.
      Without using division was kind of hard until I realized that I could create 2 auxiliaries arrays to build up all the terms of the output.

# Day 3:
      This problem was asked by Stripe.
      Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

      Classified as: Hard
      My impression: Hard

      Challenge:
      Linear time and constant space.

      Diary:
      It took me a couple days to solve it, because i was trying a very inefficient approach, using pointers to the sequence of numbers that has the lower header.

# Day 4:
      This problem was asked by Jane Street.

      cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

      Classified as: Medium
      My impression: Very very easy

      Challenge: I don't know what to add here 

      Diary: It was the easiest one. Straightforward
# Day 5:
      This problem was asked by Google.

      Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.

      Classified as: Medium
      My impression: Medium

      Challenge: I don't know what to add here 

      Diary: To implement serialize was very easy, but to implement serialize I had to remember how to do a parsing, consume tokens and this kind of stuff.
