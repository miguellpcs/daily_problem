# daily_coding_problems
 A different problem (and headache) everyday
# Day 1 (Easy):
      This problem was recently asked by Google.
      Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.
      
      Challenge:
      LINEAR TIME!

      Diary:
      It was pretty easy to solve in linear time when I remembered that python takes constant time to verify if a given value is a valid key of a dictionary. HASH TABLES, BABY.

# Day 2 (Hard):
      This problem was asked by Uber.
      Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array  except the one at i.
      
      Challenge:
      To not use division >:(

      Diary:
      Very easy using division.
      Without using division was kind of hard until I realized that I could create 2 auxiliaries arrays to build up all the terms of the output.
